##My process
i started from the html and went on up from there everything was going smooth
but the I hadn’t figured out that the container contained a box shadow that
took me a while to figure it out .

## Built with 
html and css
flexbox
 
##What i learned 
the main part that took me a while was 
<div class="container">
      <div class="nft">
        <img class="eq-image" src="./images/image-equilibrium.jpg">
        <div class="hovernft">
          <img class="hovernftimg" src="./images/icon-view.svg" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="title1">
        Equilibrium #3429
      </div>
      <div class="detail1">
        Our Equilibrium collection promotes balance and calm.
      </div>
      <div class="detail2">
        <div class="price">
            <img src="./images/icon-ethereum.svg" alt="" srcset="">
          0.041 ETH
        </div>
        <div class="dayleft">
            <img class="clock" src="./images/icon-clock.svg" alt="" srcset="">
          <span>3 days left</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="creator">
        <img class="photo" src="./images/image-avatar.png" alt="">
        <span>Creation of</span> 
        <span>Jules Wyvern</span>
      </div>
    </div>
 i used this to create the box shadow
css

box-shadow: 0px 20px 15px 15px hsl(216deg 61% 9%);
### Continued development
i would like to be able to pick colors easier
